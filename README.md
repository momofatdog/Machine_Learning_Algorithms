# INDE577 â€” Data Science and Machine Learning 
by Mengting Wang

Instructor: Randy R. Davila 


This is a repository for all projects completed in my INDE577 Data Science and Machine Learning class at Rice University for the Fall 2021 semester. This data science course includes algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. This course is primarily reliant on programming, and I utilized **Python** as my programming language. Sub-repositories of this repository will contain data sets, README files, and Jupyter notebooks displaying implementations of the algorithms covered in this course.
