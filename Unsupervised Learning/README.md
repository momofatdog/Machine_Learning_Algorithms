# Unsupervised Learning

An unsupervised learning method does not explicitly label the input into separate groups, hence there are no labels. The model can learn from data by detecting implicit patterns. Unsupervised Learning systems recognize data based on its densities, structures, comparable segments, and other similar characteristics. Cluster analysis is one of the most extensively utilized unsupervised learning techniques.

**Clustering**, also known as cluster analysis, is a technique for grouping comparable sets of items in the same group that are not the same as the objects in another group. 

One of the most important clustering techniques is **K-means clustering**. The goal of k-means clustering is to divide the data's n observations into k groups so that each observation belongs to the cluster with the closest mean.
