# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the most commonly used paradigm for executing machine learning operations. It is commonly used for data that has a precise mapping between input and output data. In this scenario, the dataset is labeled, which means that the algorithm clearly recognizes the characteristics and performs predictions or classification correspondingly. The algorithm is able to determine the connection between the two variables as the training period proceeds, allowing us to predict a new outcome.

When it comes to data mining, supervised learning may be divided into two types of problems: **classification** and **regression**: 
* Classification uses an algorithm to properly allocate test data to certain groups. It identifies particular entities in the dataset and seeks to derive inferences about how those items should be labeled or described. 
* Regression is a statistical method for determining the connection between dependent and independent variables. It is widely used to produce projections.


Some of the algorithms that come under supervised learning are as follows:
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest
* Gradient Descent
* Logistic Regression
* Perception
* Multiple Layer Perception
* Enseble Learning
* Decision Tree
