# Linear Regression
This project focuses on the linear regression technique for lagged Time-Series variables. Time series forecasting has huge economic relevance since vital business data such as demand and sales, the number of visits to a website, stock price, and so on are fundamentally time series data. In a multiple regression model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of predictors. In an autoregression model, we forecast the variable of interest by using a linear combination of the variable's past values. Autoregression is the regression of a variable against itself.

## Data
I will use **Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL)** closing stock price as a sample time series data.

## Package 
I will use the following packages in this project:
* [matplotlib.pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [pandas_datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)
